CommonNET
=========

A slowly building collection of my common libraries.

* Common.Data.SqlClient - Shortcuts and common code for SQL data readers and commands
* Common.Reflection - Shortcuts for handling some of the most used reflections in .NET.
* Common.DateTimeOffsetExtender - Handle DateTimeOffset change of TimeZone, and a couple more related methods.
 * This is obsoleted code. Just GOOGLE: "DateTimeOffset Change Timezone". Don't Bing it, the results will be useless.
* Common.DictionaryStringStringHelper - Provides casting shortcuts for Dictionary<string,string> objects that are pretty common for websites.
* Common.Reflection.AttributeReader - Simplifies the reading of an object's attributes in runtime.
* Common.SystemStringUtilities - More common string utilities for working with web development.
* Common.XMLTools - Shortcut for getting nodes from an XPath being applied to current node. I may make a version of this for jSON later.
* More to come
